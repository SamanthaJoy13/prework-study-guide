# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project because I wanted to learn the ins and outs of coding. This project allowed me to explore and familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript, and much more. It also allowed me to store the information I learned and would like to look back on in the future. Through creating the Prework Study Guide webpage, I was able to learn how to create a webpage's frame through HTML, how to add aesthetics to the webpage through CSS, how to make for loops with JS, and how to work with terminal, VS, and Github to create and update my project.
